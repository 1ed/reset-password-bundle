# ResetPasswordBundle

Worrying about how to deal with users that can't remember their password? We've got you covered! This bundle provides a secure out of the box solution to allow users to reset their forgotten passwords.

## Requirements

Most Symfony application's using Symfony 4.4 or newer should already have all the required dependencies to use this bundle, and the optional traits that are included with it. 

If your application isn't a traditional Symfony web application, see the [detailed requirements](https://github.com/SymfonyCasts/reset-password-bundle/wiki/Dependencies) in our wiki.

## Installation

@TODO - To be added upon release

## Configuration

We highly recommend using `bin/console make:reset-password` from [MakerBundle](https://github.com/symfony/maker-bundle) to generate and configure the required application files that the bundle needs to function as intended. 

Symfony's Flex creates the bundle's `config/packages/reset_password.yaml` config file. The `reset_request_repository` param is populated with a fake request repository value which must be changed before use. `bin/console make:reset-password` has you covered there too.

Checkout the [configuration reference](https://github.com/SymfonyCasts/reset-password-bundle/wiki/Confguration-Reference) in the wiki for more detailed configuration information.

## Usage

If you used our Symfony Maker command `bin/console make:reset-password` after installation, your app is ready to go. The bundle's default route endpoints look like `/reset-password/request`. These endpoints can be customized in the controller generated by the maker command. 

Go to `https://your-apps-domain/reset-password/request`, fill out the form, click on the link sent to your email, and change your password. That's it! The Reset Password Bundle takes care of the rest. 

The above assumes you have already setup [authentication](https://symfony.com/doc/current/security.html) and registered user account in your app.
